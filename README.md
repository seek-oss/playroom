Simultaneously design across a variety of themes and screen sizes, powered by JSX and your own component library.

Playroom allows you to create a zero-install code-oriented design environment, built into a standalone bundle that can be deployed alongside your existing design system documentation.

- Iterate on your designs in the final medium.
- Create quick mock-ups and interactive prototypes with real code.
- Exercise and evaluate the flexibility of your design system.
- Share your work with others by simply copying the URL.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev playroom
```

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "playroom:start": "playroom start",
    "playroom:build": "playroom build"
  }
}
```

Add a `playroom.config.js` file to the root of your project:

```js
module.exports = {
  components: './src/components',
  outputPath: './dist/playroom',

  // Optional:
  title: 'My Awesome Library',
  themes: './src/themes',
  snippets: './playroom/snippets.js',
  frameComponent: './playroom/FrameComponent.js',
  scope: './playroom/useScope.js',
  widths: [320, 768, 1024],
  port: 9000,
  openBrowser: true,
  paramType: 'search', // default is 'hash'
  exampleCode: `
    <Button>
      Hello World!
    </Button>
  `,
  baseUrl: '/playroom/',
  webpackConfig: () => ({
    // Custom webpack config goes here...
  }),
  iframeSandbox: 'allow-scripts',
};
```

_Note: `port` and `openBrowser` options will be set to `9000` and `true` (respectively) by default whenever they are omitted from the config above._

Your `components` file is expected to export a single object or a series of named exports. For example:

```js
export { default as Text } from '../Text'; // Re-exporting a default export
export { Button } from '../Button'; // Re-exporting a named export
// etc...
```

The `iframeSandbox` option can be used to set the [`sandbox` attribute](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/) on Playroom's iframe. A minimum of `allow-scripts` is required for Playroom to work.

Now that your project is configured, you can start a local development server:

```bash
$ npm run playroom:start
```

To build your assets for production:

```bash
$ npm run playroom:build
```

## Snippets

Playroom allows you to quickly insert predefined snippets of code, providing live previews across themes and viewports as you navigate the list. These snippets can be configured via a `snippets` file that looks like this:

```js
export default [
  {
    group: 'Button',
    name: 'Strong',
    code: `
      <Button weight="strong">
        Button
      </Button>
    `,
  },
  // etc...
];
```

## Custom Frame Component

If your components need to be nested within custom provider components, you can provide a custom React component file via the `frameComponent` option, which is a path to a file that exports a component. For example, if your component library has multiple themes:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '../path/to/your/theming-system';

export default function FrameComponent({ theme, children }) {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

## Custom Scope

You can provide extra variables within the scope of your JSX via the `scope` option, which is a path to a file that exports a `useScope` Hook that returns a scope object. For example, if you wanted to expose a context-based `theme` variable to consumers of your Playroom:

```js
import { useTheme } from '../path/to/your/theming-system';

export default function useScope() {
  return {
    theme: useTheme(),
  };
```

## Theme Support

If your component library has multiple themes, you can customise Playroom to render every theme simultaneously via the `themes` configuration option.

Similar to your `components` file, your `themes` file is expected to export a single object or a series of named exports. For example:

```js
export { themeA } from './themeA';
export { themeB } from './themeB';
// etc...
```

## TypeScript Support

If a `tsconfig.json` file is present in your project, static prop types are parsed using [react-docgen-typescript](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-docgen-typescript) to provide better autocompletion in the Playroom editor.

**By default, all `.ts` and `.tsx` files in the current working directory are included, excluding `node_modules`.**

If you need to customise this behaviour, you can provide a `typeScriptFiles` option in `playroom.config.js`, which is an array of globs.

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  typeScriptFiles: ['src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}', '!**/node_modules'],
};
```

If you need to customise the [parser options](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-docgen-typescript#options), you can provide a `reactDocgenTypescriptConfig` option in `playroom.config.js`.

For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reactDocgenTypescriptConfig: {
    propFilter: (prop, component) => {
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```
