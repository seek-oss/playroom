'playroom': major
---

This release is a huge upgrade to the user interface of Playroom, with enhanced workflow, usability and aesthetics.
The motivation behind these upgrades is to enable local design iteration, giving users the ability to switch between stored designs while still preserving Playroom's ability to collaborate via shared links â€” all without requiring a backend service.

Highlights of the new interface include:

- Designs autosave locally in the browser, using the title as a name
- Return visits no longer restore the last code, instead listing locally saved designs as an option (or just start fresh)
- Add "Open Playroom" option (with thumbnail previews) to make switchin between designs easier
- Add "New Playroom" option to quickly start fresh
- Add "Duplicate" option to start a design variation
- Improved affordance of editor actions, i.e. snippets, format, as well as cursor and selection actions.
- Add "Show/Hide UI" option (with keyboard shortcut) to make focusing on design frames easier
- Replace splash screen on Preview mode with dismissable header
- Add "Edit" link to Preview mode header to make returning code easier
- Add footer to Preview mode when embedding links
