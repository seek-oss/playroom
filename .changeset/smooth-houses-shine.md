'playroom': major
---

This release features a major design overhaul, modernising the interface and introducing some exciting new features.
Virtual file management now enables switching between multiple designs locally in the browser, while still supporting collaboration via shareable links.

Highlights of the new interface include:

- Designs autosave locally in the browser, using the title as a name
- Return visits no longer restore the last code, instead listing locally saved designs as an option (or just start fresh)
- Add "Open Playroom" option (with thumbnail previews) to make switching between designs easier
- Add "New Playroom" option to quickly start fresh
- Add "Duplicate" option to start a design variation
- Improved affordance of editor actions, i.e. snippets, format, as well as cursor and selection actions.
- Add "Show/Hide UI" option (with keyboard shortcut) to make focusing on design frames easier
- Replace splash screen on Preview mode with dismissable header
- Add "Edit" link to Preview mode header to make returning code easier
- Add footer to Preview mode when embedding links
- Improve affordance of syntax errors, including jump to line feature
