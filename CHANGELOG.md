## 0.28.2

### Patch Changes

- 8030325: Update all dependencies
- 8030325: Fix error message on gutter marker tooltip

  Playroom wraps the code in a Fragment to compile it and then removes it from the error message displayed as a tooltip on the gutter marker if it fails to compile.

  The logic has been improved to remove the first occurence of an opening `<React.Fragment>` and the last occurence of `</React.Fragment>`.

  Errors should no longer incorrectly have a stray closing fragment:

  ```diff
  "unknown: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <Boxerror>. (3:0)

     1 | <Boxerror>
     2 |   ...
  -> 3 | </Box></React.Fragment>
  +> 3 | </Box>
       | ^"
  ```

- cbcf1cf: Update dependencies (and move to pnpm internally)
